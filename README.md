# Habbo Hotel group badges
This documentation explains how badges are structured and how they are hashed.

## Badge structure
Badges typically consist of <b>0-9</b> badge parts. Badge parts are divided in 3 different types:
- Base parts
- Additional parts (1-99)
- Additional parts (100-199)

Both types of badge parts are built using 1 letter and 5 digits:

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Type</b></td>
<td><b>Badge part ID</b></td>
<td><b>Color</b></td>
<td><b>Position</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> b/s/t</td>
<td> 01-99</td>
<td> 01-24</td>
<td> 0-8</td>
</tr>
</table>
